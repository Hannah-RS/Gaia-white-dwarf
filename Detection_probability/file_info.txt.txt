This file lists the difference between the files in this folder, which are not python scripts.
These files in the Results folder are created using total_detection_probability.py

Results subfolder: 
Probabilities: 
pjk_ = detection probabilities
ll_pjk_ = lower limit on detection probabilities
ul_pjk = upper limit on detection probabilities

Distributions
detected_planets_* : (d^2N_{det}/dloga\:dlogM)_{jk} 
error_planets_*: \sigma (d^2N_{det}/dloga\:dlogM)_{jk}

The appendices refer to different cuts applied to the catalogue
enoise: primary catalogue used in analysis (see paper for cut details)
15mag : all white dwarfs have Gmag<15
minus_3me: all white dwarfs have M-3\sigma < Mf
plus_3me: all white dwarfs have M +3\sigma< Mf
minus_3_cut: all white dwarfs have M < Mf-3\sigma
plus_3_cut: all white dwarfs have M < Mf+3\sigma
minus_1_cut: all white dwarfs have M < Mf-\sigma - used as Mf-3\sigma excludes almost all WD in the catalogue


The detfract10yr file is detection probabilities in square bins from Ranalli et al. 2018 for a 10 year mission.
alpha_map.csv - dictionary of astrometric noise as a function of semi-major axis and mass, created in Detection Probability heatmaps notebook

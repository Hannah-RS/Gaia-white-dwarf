smaller_data_ all the white dwarfs in the catalogue above but only importing certain properties so it is less memory intensive
smaller_data: created by import_data.py, used for main calculation
	imports Gaia broadband magnitude, distance, mass, probability of being a white dwarf
mass_error : created by import_data_mass_error.py used for estimating importance of mass cut off
	imports Gaia broadband magnitude, distance, mass, error on mass, probability of being a white dwarf
with_name: created by import_data_with_names.py
	as above but excluding mass error and including source id, parallax, WD J + J2000 RA (hh mm ss.ss)  + Dec. (dd mm ss.s), equinox and epoch 2000


filtered_data_ - these files are created using transform_data.py with different cuts
enoise: primary catalogue used in analysis (see paper for cut details) created by transform_data.py
the rest of these files are created by transform_data_mass_error

15mag : all white dwarfs have Gmag<15
minus_3me: all white dwarfs have M-3\sigma < Mf
plus_3me: all white dwarfs have M +3\sigma< Mf
minus_3_cut: all white dwarfs have M < Mf-3\sigma
plus_3_cut: all white dwarfs have M < Mf+3\sigma
minus_1_cut: all white dwarfs have M < Mf-\sigma - used as Mf-3\sigma excludes almost all WD in the catalogue
